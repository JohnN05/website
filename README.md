# Personal Website
### My personal website which displays my skills, recent projects, and other social medias.

This repository is for [johnjng.com](https://johnjng.com) and shows the entire process of the websites development.  This React.JS website serves as a introduction to me and aportfolio for some of my projects.  When I created this website, I did my best to make everything fully responsive as well as dynamic so I wouldn't need to constantly update its information.
